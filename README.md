### From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
### Mains level: Religious Composition of the Population.

**The working paper released by the Economic Advisory Council (EAC) to the Prime Minister makes an erroneous assertion regarding the growth of the Muslim population.**

## Composition of the Population of various communities highlighted by EAC:
- Absolute Increase in Population (1950-2015): Hindu population grew by 701 million. The Muslim population increased by 146 million.
- Proportional Changes: The proportion of Hindus in the population fell by 6.64 percentage points (from 84.7% in 1950 to 78.06% in 2015). The proportion of Muslims increased by 4.25 percentage points (from 9.84% in 1950 to 14.09% in 2015).
- Despite these changes, the Muslim population remains significantly smaller compared to the Hindu population.
