![image](https://github.com/Allan122/.C-A/assets/45638226/54f0b038-853f-4d6b-8552-f84bc1e0669c)

**The working paper released by the Economic Advisory Council (EAC) to the Prime Minister makes an erroneous assertion regarding the growth of the Muslim population.**

## Composition of the Population of various communities highlighted by EAC:
- Absolute Increase in Population (1950-2015): Hindu population grew by 701 million. The Muslim population increased by 146 million.
- Proportional Changes: The proportion of Hindus in the population fell by 6.64 percentage points (from 84.7% in 1950 to 78.06% in 2015). The proportion of Muslims increased by 4.25 percentage points (from 9.84% in 1950 to 14.09% in 2015).
- Despite these changes, the Muslim population remains significantly smaller compared to the Hindu population.


**What does the 2011 census say?**
- The proportion of the Hindu population to the total population in 2011 declined by 0.7 percentage points (PP);
- the proportion of the Sikh population declined by 0.2 PP and the Buddhist population declined by 0.1 PP during the decade 2001-2011.
- The proportion of the Muslim population to the total population has increased by 0.8 PP.
- There has been no significant change in the proportion of Christians & Jains.

**Issue of Misinterpretation and Sensationalism of Data:**
- Misleading Media Reports: Many media reports and politicians have sensationalized the findings of the EAC-PM working paper inaccurately suggesting that the Muslim population in India is growing rapidly while posing a threat to the Hindu population.
- Such interpretations contribute to a divisive political narrative and misinform the public about population issues.
- Limitations of the Paper: The working paper itself states that understanding changes in religious demography is a multivariate phenomenon. However, the paper does not contain sufficient evidence to support this claim.


**The true story behind this Data:**
- Influence of Socio-Economic Factors: Population growth is significantly influenced by socio-economic conditions such as education, healthcare, and economic opportunities. - Higher fertility rates in a community often reflect lower levels of socio-economic development rather than religious factors.
- Policies and Development Indicators: The Muslim community in India has a higher population growth rate primarily because it lags in some of the Population and Marriage policies that affect socio-economic development indicators as compared to the Hindu community.

**Need for Exact Data:**
- Contextual Analysis: Detailed analysis is essential to avoid misinterpretation of demographic changes. Understanding the multi-faceted reasons behind population changes requires considering socio-economic, cultural, and political factors.
- Religious Composition: According to the Pew Research Center (2021), the proportion of India’s six largest religious groups has remained relatively stable since Partition.
- Fertility Rates: Recent National Family Health Survey (NFHS) rounds indicate significant declines in Muslim fertility rates.

**Conclusion: Accurate and comprehensive analysis is necessary to understand population trends and avoid fueling divisive narratives.**

### Q: Major cities of India are becoming vulnerable to flood conditions. Discuss. (UPSC IAS/2016)

India's major cities, such as Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, and Delhi, are increasingly becoming vulnerable to flood conditions due to a combination of natural and human-induced factors. The vulnerability to floods is exacerbated by the following factors:

#### Causes of Flood Vulnerability:

1. **Climate Change**: Increased frequency and intensity of rainfall due to climate change lead to urban flooding. Unpredictable weather patterns cause heavy downpours in short periods, overwhelming drainage systems.
   
2. **Poor Urban Planning**: Rapid and unplanned urbanization has led to the encroachment on natural water bodies, floodplains, and wetlands that traditionally acted as buffers against flooding.

3. **Inadequate Drainage Systems**: Many Indian cities have outdated and insufficient drainage systems that cannot handle heavy rainfall. Blockages due to solid waste, siltation, and encroachments further exacerbate the problem.

4. **Encroachment of Water Bodies**: Construction activities on riverbanks, lakes, and other water bodies reduce their capacity to absorb floodwaters. Unauthorized construction and illegal settlements often occur in flood-prone areas.

5. **Land Use Changes**: Conversion of permeable green spaces into impermeable surfaces (concrete and asphalt) reduces groundwater recharge and increases surface runoff during rains.

6. **Lack of Coordination**: Poor coordination among various government departments and lack of effective disaster management plans contribute to the cities' flood vulnerability.

#### Recent Examples:

- **Mumbai Floods (2005, 2017, 2019)**: Caused by extreme rainfall events, poor drainage systems, and encroachment on Mithi River.
- **Chennai Floods (2015)**: Resulted from heavy rainfall, release of water from reservoirs, and encroachment on wetlands.
- **Kolkata Floods**: Regular flooding due to heavy rains, poor drainage, and low-lying geography.

#### Mitigation Measures:

1. **Urban Planning and Zoning Regulations**: Enforce strict zoning regulations to prevent construction on floodplains and wetlands.
2. **Improvement of Drainage Systems**: Upgrade and maintain urban drainage systems to handle heavy rainfall.
3. **Restoration of Natural Water Bodies**: Reclaim and rejuvenate natural water bodies and wetlands to enhance their flood absorption capacity.
4. **Rainwater Harvesting**: Implement rainwater harvesting systems to reduce surface runoff.
5. **Flood Early Warning Systems**: Develop and implement advanced flood forecasting and warning systems.
6. **Public Awareness**: Increase public awareness about flood risks and preparedness measures.

### From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
### Prelims level: Golden Rice, Food Fortification, GM Crops

**Why in the News?**
The Court of Appeals of the Philippines revoked biosafety permits for GM Golden Rice and BT eggplant, citing safety violations and ordering a halt until issues are resolved.

### Golden Rice and Bt Eggplant in the Philippines 
**What is Golden Rice?**
- Golden Rice is a variety of rice (Oryza sativa) developed through genetic engineering to produce beta-carotene, a precursor of vitamin A, in the edible parts of the rice.
- This modification aims to address vitamin A deficiency, particularly in areas where it’s prevalent.
- The Philippines approved its commercial production in 2021.
- The Philippines became the first country to officially issue a biosafety permit for commercially propagating golden rice in July 2021.
**Bt Eggplant:** Developed by the University of the Philippines Los Banos (UPLB), Bt eggplant is engineered to resist pests, aiming to enhance farmer productivity and reduce environmental impact.

### Genetics:
Golden rice incorporates Psy and CrtI genes from daffodils and a soil bacterium into the rice genome to enhance beta-carotene production in the endosperm.

**Field Trials and Approvals:**
- The first field trials of golden rice cultivars were conducted by Louisiana State University Agricultural Center in 2004.
- Additional trials were conducted in the Philippines, Taiwan, and Bangladesh.
- In 2018, Canada and the United States approved golden rice as safe for consumption.
- In 2019, the Philippines approved golden rice for use as human food, animal feed, or for processing.

### **In the context of India** 
- Currently, there is no cultivation or commercialisation of Golden Rice in India. Growing and selling GM brinjal remains banned in India.
- India has approved commercial cultivation of only one GM crop, Bt cotton. No GM food crop has ever been approved for commercial cultivation in the country.

**Vandana Shiva**, an Indian anti-GMO activist, has argued against golden rice, citing potential issues with loss of biodiversity and availability of diverse and nutritionally adequate food.

**Golden Rice 2:**
- In 2005, researchers at Syngenta developed Golden Rice 2, which contains the phytoene synthase (psy) gene from maise combined with the crtl gene from the original golden rice.
- Golden Rice 2 produces significantly higher levels of carotenoids, particularly beta-carotene, compared to the original golden rice.

   - This statement is incorrect. GM mustard, specifically the DMH-11 variety, has been engineered primarily for hybridization purposes to increase yield, not for pest resistance. The genes from soil bacterium in GM mustard enable the plant to produce hybrid seeds by promoting cross-pollination rather than offering pest resistance.

2. **GM mustard has the genes that allow the plant cross-pollination and hybridization.**  
   - This statement is correct. GM mustard has been genetically modified to include barnase, barstar, and bar genes, which facilitate cross-pollination and hybridization, leading to higher yields.

3. **GM mustard has been developed jointly by the IARI and Punjab Agricultural University.**  
   - This statement is incorrect. GM mustard has been developed by the Centre for Genetic Manipulation of Crop Plants (CGMCP) at the University of Delhi.

### PYQ [2013] In the context of the Indian economy, ‘Open Market Operations’ refers to:

(a) borrowing by scheduled banks from the RBI  
(b) lending by commercial banks to industry and trade  
(c) purchase and sale of government securities by the RBI  
(d) None of the above

**Answer: (c) purchase and sale of government securities by the RBI**

**Explanation:**

Open Market Operations (OMOs) are a key tool used by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for managing liquidity and controlling the money supply in the economy. OMOs involve the purchase and sale of government securities in the open market.

- When the RBI wants to inject liquidity into the banking system, it buys government securities.
- Conversely, when the RBI wants to absorb excess liquidity, it sells government securities.

This mechanism helps in stabilizing interest rates and controlling inflation by influencing the amount of money circulating in the economy. Therefore, the correct answer is (c) purchase and sale of government securities by the RBI.

### PYQ:
#### [2018] Which of the following is/are the possible consequence/s of heavy sand mining in riverbeds?

1. Decreased salinity in the river
2. Pollution of groundwater
3. Lowering of the water-table

Select the correct answer using the code given below:

(a) 1 only

(b) 2 and 3 only

(c) 1 and 3 only

(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Answer: (b) 2 and 3 only**

**Explanation:**
- **Pollution of groundwater:** Heavy sand mining can lead to pollution as the excavation processes may introduce pollutants and disturb the natural filtration process of the riverbed.
- **Lowering of the water-table:** Sand mining can lower the water-table by increasing the permeability of the riverbed, which enhances the downward movement of water into the aquifer, reducing the availability of surface water.
- **Decreased salinity in the river** is not a likely consequence of sand mining; instead, it could potentially lead to increased salinity due to reduced freshwater flow.
<br>
#### [2019] With reference to the management of minor minerals in India, consider the following statements:

1. Sand is a ‘minor mineral’ according to the prevailing law in the country.
2. State governments have the power to grant mining leases of minor minerals, but the powers regarding the formation of rules related to the grant of minor minerals lie with the Central Government.
3. State Governments have the power to frame rules to prevent illegal mining of minor minerals.

### Critically Examine the Supreme Court’s Judgement on the National Judicial Appointments Commission Act, 2014

The Supreme Court's judgement on the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC) Act, 2014, is a landmark decision that has significant implications for the appointment of judges in India's higher judiciary. Here is a critical examination of the judgement:

#### Background
- **NJAC Act, 2014:** The NJAC Act aimed to replace the collegium system of judicial appointments with a commission comprising members from the judiciary, the executive, and eminent persons.
- **Purpose:** The Act was intended to bring transparency and accountability to the process of appointing judges to the Supreme Court and High Courts.

#### Supreme Court’s Judgement
- **Verdict:** In October 2015, a five-judge Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court struck down the NJAC Act and the 99th Constitutional Amendment, declaring them unconstitutional and void.
- **Reasoning:** The Court held that the NJAC Act violated the basic structure of the Constitution, particularly the independence of the judiciary.

#### Key Points of the Judgement
1. **Independence of the Judiciary:**
   - The Court emphasized that judicial independence is a basic feature of the Constitution, essential for maintaining the rule of law and protecting individual rights.
   - Inclusion of the Law Minister and two eminent persons in the NJAC was seen as compromising this independence by allowing potential executive interference.

2. **Basic Structure Doctrine:**
   - The judgement reiterated the importance of the basic structure doctrine, which protects fundamental constitutional principles from being altered by legislative amendments.
   - It was argued that the NJAC Act infringed upon the basic structure by undermining judicial primacy in appointments.

3. **Collegium System:**
   - The Court acknowledged the flaws in the collegium system but maintained that it was preferable to the NJAC model for preserving judicial independence.
   - The judgement called for reforms within the collegium system to enhance transparency and accountability.

#### Criticism of the Judgement
- **Lack of Transparency:** Critics argue that the collegium system is opaque and lacks accountability, and the judgement missed an opportunity to establish a more transparent mechanism.
- **Judicial Overreach:** Some view the judgement as judicial overreach, asserting that the judiciary protected its own interests by striking down a law passed by Parliament.
- **Reform Needs:** While the Court recognized the need for reforms, the judgement did not provide a concrete alternative to address the issues plaguing the collegium system.

**KAZA Summit 2024: Delegates renew calls to leave CITES**

### From UPSC perspective, the following things are important:
### Prelims level: About CITES;
### Mains level: The Kaza Summit and its objectives.

Why in the news?
At the KAZA 2024 Summit in Livingstone, Zambia, delegates reiterated the urge for member states to withdraw from CITES because they seek approval to trade their plentiful ivory and wildlife items.

About the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES):
It is an international agreement adopted in 1973 (entered into force in 1975) between governments.
Aim: To ensure that international trade in wild animals and plants does not threaten their survival.
Headquarters: Geneva, Switzerland.
Although CITES is legally binding on the Parties – in other words, they have to implement the Convention–it does not take the place of national laws.
Representatives of CITES nations meet every two to three years at a Conference of the Parties (COP) to review progress and adjust the lists of protected species, which are grouped into three categories with different levels of protection:
Appendix I: Includes the world’s most endangered plants and animals, such as tigers and gorillas. International commercial trade in these species, or even parts of them, is completely banned, except in rare cases such as scientific research.
Appendix II: Contains species like corals that are not yet threatened with extinction, but which could become threatened if unlimited trade were allowed. Also included are “look-alike” species that closely resemble those already on the list for conservation reasons. Plants and animals in this category can be traded internationally, but there are strict rules.
Appendix III: Species whose trade is only regulated within a specific country can be placed on Appendix III if that country requires cooperation from other nations to help prevent exploitation.

At the KAZA (Kavango-Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area) Summit 2024, delegates have renewed their calls for member countries to consider leaving CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora). Here’s what happened:

#### Key Points:

1. **Frustration with CITES:** 
   - Delegates expressed frustration over CITES regulations, which they believe restrict their ability to manage wildlife and benefit economically from their natural resources.

2. **Economic Impact:** 
   - Many delegates argued that CITES rules limit sustainable use of wildlife, affecting tourism and local economies that depend on wildlife resources.

3. **Sovereignty Concerns:** 
   - There were strong sentiments about the need for member countries to have more control over their own wildlife management policies without external interference.

4. **Call for Independence:** 
   - The delegates emphasized the importance of creating policies that reflect the unique needs and circumstances of the KAZA region, rather than being constrained by global regulations.

#### What’s Next?

The discussion at the summit indicates a growing desire among KAZA member countries to re-evaluate their participation in CITES and consider alternative approaches to wildlife conservation and economic development.
